# Jay-Alexander Elliot

I build **resilient, offline-capable systems** across **Go · TypeScript · Elixir**. I’m finishing my B.S. in Software Engineering (WGU) and planning grad school in **Cybersecurity** (institution TBD) and **Engineering Management** (Vanderbilt).

---

## What I’m doing now
- 🚀 **MCP Platform**: Go MCP server with a driver-style plugin system; React/TypeScript frontend refresh; Elixir/OTP services for reliability and fault tolerance.
- 🧪 **Reliability**: Chaos drills, backoffs/circuit breakers, NATS/JetStream for decoupling, end-to-end tracing (OpenTelemetry).
- 🎓 **Next up**: MS in Cybersecurity (TBD) + Engineering Management at Vanderbilt.

## Tech I use (and like)
**Languages:** Go, TypeScript (learning Elixir)  
**Platform:** Docker, Linux  
**Data:** Postgres (pgvector when needed)  
**Cloud:** AWS  
**Practices:** OTP supervision trees, CQRS-ish job pipelines (Oban), IaC, CI/CD

## Selected interests
- Offline-first apps that degrade gracefully
- Fault-tolerant backends (OTP) talking to Go tools
- Practical AI/RAG for real workloads (e.g., legal & compliance)

## Writing & demos
- Blog (coming soon; cross-posted to Medium with canonical links)
- Small, runnable repos + “how it works” notes every two weeks

## Work with me
- Open to roles or collabs in **platform reliability**, **security-minded backend**, or **Go/Elixir systems**.
- Short consulting/implementation packages for **offline-ready RAG** or **resilience hardening**.
